## Usage

Discover all SSDP services:

```java
    SsdpClient client = SsdpClient.create();
    DiscoveryRequest all = SsdpRequest.discoverAll();
    client.discoverServices(all, new DiscoveryListener() {
      @Override
      public void onServiceDiscovered(SsdpService service) {
        System.out.println("Found service: " + service);
      }

      @Override
      public void onServiceAnnouncement(SsdpServiceAnnouncement announcement) {
        System.out.println("Service announced something: " + announcement);
      }
    });
```

Discover specific SSDP service by serviceType:

```java
    SsdpClient client = SsdpClient.create();
    DiscoveryRequest networkStorageDevice = DiscoveryRequest.builder()
    .serviceType("urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:networkstoragedevice:1")
    .build();
    client.discoverServices(networkStorageDevice, new DiscoveryListener() {
      @Override
      public void onServiceDiscovered(SsdpService service) {
        System.out.println("Found service: " + service);
      }

      @Override
      public void onServiceAnnouncement(SsdpServiceAnnouncement announcement) {
        System.out.println("Service announced something: " + announcement);
      }
    });
```

Discovery is not a mandatory activity. You might just want to listen to announcements:
```java
    SsdpClient client = SsdpClient.create();
    client.discoverServices(null, new DiscoveryListener() {
      @Override
      public void onServiceDiscovered(SsdpService service) {
        System.out.println("Found service: " + service);
      }

      @Override
      public void onServiceAnnouncement(SsdpServiceAnnouncement announcement) {
        System.out.println("Service announced something: " + announcement);
      }
    });
```

When you're done, don't forget to stop the discovery:
```java
ssdpClient.stopDiscovery();
```
